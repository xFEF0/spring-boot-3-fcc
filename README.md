# spring-boot-3-fcc
## Description
This project is based on the [FreeCodeCamp Spring Boot 3](https://github.com/danvega/fcc-spring-boot-3) project by Dan Vega, following the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31KTdfRH6nY). 
It is designed to help us learn and build applications using Spring Boot 3. The project includes a basic setup for a Spring Boot application and can be extended.

## Features
- Spring Boot 3 integration
- RESTful API endpoints
- Database integration (e.g., H2, PostgreSQL)
- Unit and integration tests
- Docker support
